# Bullet_journal_cli
Making a command line version of bullet journal
This project was created with the intent of strengthening my OOP skills. 
For those who dont know what a bullet journal is , here is a quick link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM

This is a work in progress and I would love to take suggestions on trying to make this better. I have a seperate feature list document that i will update (with feature resquest and completed things)
I do not intend to move to a gui and want to keep it as a command line interafce only.
